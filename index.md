As a Researcher, I work on developing and implementing research strategies that address Africaâ€™s development challenges through technology. In that role, I collect contextual data about development challenges, develop and test potential solutions with intended users, and identify markets for those solutions.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis, for my work in the fate of organic pollutants in wastewater and agricultural systems. I also have a M.Sc. degree from the University of California, Davis, for my research in the development and implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) technologies in Uganda. I received my B.Sc. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Riverside.

Please see my curriculum vitae for a complete summary of my professional and academic history.  You can contact me at <a href="mailto:Taogunyoku@gmail.com">Taogunyoku@gmail.com</a> for further questions or information.
